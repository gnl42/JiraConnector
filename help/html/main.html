The Mylyn Tasks Connector: Jira is an Eclipse plugin that lets you
work with the Atlassian products within your IDE. Now you don't
have to switch between websites, email messages and news feeds to
see what's happening to your project and your code. Instead, you
can see the relevant <a href=http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira>JIRA</a> issues
and <a href=http://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo>Bamboo</a> build
information right there in your development environment.</p>
